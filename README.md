# PILDesign

It's not graphic design, its PIL design?

I am not using python to build graphics as apposed to Gimp.  But the API for drawing to the canvas isn't quite as intuitive and streamlined as I'd like.  So this library allows the user to interface with PIL in a way that's less redundant and in a way that is familiar to how Gimp concepts are understood.
